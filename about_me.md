# Deafqnd

I'm Deafqnd and I do a lot of sim racing when I'm not buried in homework :/
Mainly Formula spec cars but I also dabble in Endurance Prototypes and the like

I also enjoy Minecraft and Pokemon sometimes but usually im racing lmao

Hopefully I can get into some cool coding projects and stuff eventually
