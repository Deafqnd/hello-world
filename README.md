#Deafqnd

Hi yalls I'm Deafqnd and I usually do a lot of racing. I enjoy Formula spec cars but occasionally do endurance racing as well when I get bored. 

I'm taking an ICS course so that I can learn about coding so hopefully I can do some cool coding projects of my own!
This is gonna be a fun year
